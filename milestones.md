# JAMM Project Milestones

## Minimum Viable Product
For reference:
* A “User” is a user of our application, EarlyBird,
* A Tweeter is a user of Twitter (referred to as a Twitter ID in Twitter Docs).

Our MVP is an app that allows users to:
1. Part I: search Twitter (via API) for a single Tweeter, view their most-tweeted about topic, and view a tweet about that topic with its sentiment score.
2. Part II: Search Twitter for a single topic, view a Tweeter who tweets about it a lot, and view one of their tweets about that topic with its sentiment score.

## Additional desired features
For our app home page:
1. Link to an information page describing our app, what it does + how, and what Twitter sentiment analysis is.

For part I of our app:
1. View all of the Tweeter’s tweet relevant to the topic selected
2. Display the list of topics shaped as the Twitter logo (bird)
3. Split those tweets into positive and negative sentiment
4. Sort them by sentiment strength in each of those two categories
5. For a particular topic, calculate a net sentiment score for the Tweeter

For part II of our app:
1. View all Tweeters who tweet frequently about the topic
2. Split those Tweeters into net positive and net negative sentiment on the topic, and sort those two lists by sentiment strength
3. Display each Tweeter’s tweets split into positive and negative sentiment, and sort those two lists by sentiment strength

## Stretch features
For both parts I and II of app:
1. Store search history using cookies for convenience

For part I of our app:
1. Make sentiment analysis results for a Tweeter downloadable in a convenient format

For part II of our app:
1. Make sentiment analysis results for a topic downloadable in a convenient format

## Low-priority features
If we are behind schedule, we will de-prioritize the following:
1. All stretch features
2. The information page
3. Shaping the word cloud like the Twitter logo
