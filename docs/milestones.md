# JAMM Project Milestones

## Minimum Viable Product

For reference:

* A “User” is a user of our application, FlipaBird
* A "handle" refers to either a Reddit user ID or a subreddit name.

Our MVP is an app that allows users to:

1. submit a Reddit username and receive sentiment scores generated by a trained neural network for user-authored post titles.

## Additional desired features

For our app home page:

1. An eye-catching landing page with a brief introduction to sentiment analysis

2. Longitudinal analysis of an user's sentiment toward a topic that appear frequently within a corpus consisting of his or her posts

3. Cache data for efficient display of data

4. Implement mechanisms for users to download query result

5. Implement mechanism that allows users to label tweets for further ML training

6. A list of "trending topics" or "previous queries" to be displayed on the search page

7. A profiles page to store user preferences and allow for account updates

8. Add user interactivity/comments

## Low-priority features

If we are behind schedule, we will de-prioritize the following:
